### Who this book is written for 

This book is written for anyone who needs to communicate something to someone using data. This includes (but is certainly not limited to): analysts sharing the results of their work, students visualizing thesis data, managers needing to communicate in a data‐driven way, philanthropists proving their impact, and leaders informing their board. I believe that anyone can improve their ability to communicate effectively with data. This is an intimidating space for many, but it does not need to be.

When you are asked to “show data,” what sort of feelings does that evoke?

Perhaps you feel uncomfortable because you are unsure where to start. Or maybe it feels like an overwhelming task because you assume that what you are creating needs to be complicated and show enough detail to answer every possible question. Or perhaps you already have a solid foundation here, but are looking for that something that will help take your graphs and the stories you want to tell with them to the next level. In all of these cases, this book is written with you in mind.

### “When I’m asked to show the data, I feel…”

> An informal Twitter poll I conducted revealed the follow-ing mix of emotions when people are asked to “show the data.”

> Frustrated because I don’t think I’ll be able to tell the whole story.

> Pressure to make it clear to whomever needs the data.

> Inadequate. Boss: Can you drill down into that? Give me the split by x, y, and z.
