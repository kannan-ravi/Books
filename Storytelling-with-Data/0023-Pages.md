Being able to tell stories with data is a skill that’s becoming ever more important in our world of increasing data and desire for data-driven decision making. An effective data visualization can mean the difference between success and failure when it comes to communicating the findings of your study, raising money for your non-profit, presenting to your board, or simply getting your point across to your audience.

My experience has taught me that most people face a similar challenge: they may recognize the need to be able to communicate effectively with data but feel like they lack expertise in this space. 

People skilled in data visualization are hard to come by. Part of the challenge is that data visualization is a single step in the analytical process. Those hired into analytical roles typically have quantitative backgrounds that suit them well for the other steps (finding the data, pulling it together, analyzing it, building models), but not necessarily any formal training in design to help them when it comes to the communication of the analysis—which, by the way, is typically the only part of the analytical process that your audience ever sees. 

And increasingly, in our ever more data‐driven world, those without technical backgrounds are being asked to put on analytical hats and communicate using data.

The feelings of discomfort you may experience in this space aren’t surprising, given that being able to communicate effectively with data isn’t something that has been traditionally taught. Those who excel have typically learned what works and what doesn’t through trial and error. This can be a long and tedious process. Through this book, I hope to help expedite it for you.

### How I learned to tell stories with data 

I have always been drawn to the space where mathematics and business intersect. My educational background is mathematics and business, which enables me to communicate effectively with both sides—given that they don’t always speak the same language—and help them better understand one another. I love being able to take
